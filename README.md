Refactoring example


This is an attempt to refactor the example in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/rajkbnp/status/1367829647589793792)

## Usage:
- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies `$ composer install`
- run the demo in the console: `$ php ./demo/example.php`

The substraction operation needs some tweaks, the example goal is to demonstrate how we can get rid of if/else/switch/case.
